# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for details

# requirements_readthedocs.txt is only used by readthedocs and includes tensorflow, which is imported
#  in the root __init__.py since d7fbb98 to suppress tf 1.x deprecation warnings.
#  This causes readthedocs.io builds to fail.
