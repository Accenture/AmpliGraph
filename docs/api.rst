API
===

AmpliGraph divides its APIs in the five main submodules listed below:


.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    ampligraph.datasets
    ampligraph.latent_features
    ampligraph.evaluation
    ampligraph.discovery
    ampligraph.utils

The different submodules provide the user with support through all the operations needed when dealing with Knowledge
Graph Embedding models, from loading benchmark or user customised datasets, to saving and reloading a model after it has
been trained, validated and tested. Further, the APIs also support important downstream tasks and provide enough
flexibility to allow custom extensions from the most demanding users.
