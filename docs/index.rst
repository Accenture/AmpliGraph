AmpliGraph is a suite of neural machine learning models for relational Learning, a branch of machine learning
that deals with supervised learning on knowledge graphs.

**Use AmpliGraph if you need to**:

* Discover new knowledge from an existing knowledge graph.
* Complete large knowledge graphs with missing statements.
* Generate stand-alone knowledge graph embeddings.
* Develop and evaluate a new relational model.



AmpliGraph's machine learning models generate **knowledge graph embeddings**, vector representations of concepts in a metric space:

It then combines embeddings with model-specific scoring functions to predict unseen and novel links:

Key Features
------------

* **Intuitive APIs**: AmpliGraph APIs are designed to reduce the code amount required to learn models that predict links
in knowledge graphs. The new version AmpliGraph 2 APIs are in Keras style, making the user experience even smoother.
* **GPU-Ready**: AmpliGraph is built on top of TensorFlow 2, and it is designed to run seamlessly on CPU and GPU devices - to speed-up training.
* **Extensible**: Roll your own knowledge graph embeddings model by extending AmpliGraph base estimators.

.. The library includes Relational Learning models, i.e. supervised learning models designed to predict
.. links in knowledge graphs.

.. The tool also includes the required evaluation protocol, metrics, knowledge graph preprocessing,
.. and negative statements generator strategies.


Modules
-------

AmpliGraph includes the following submodules:

* **Datasets**: helper functions to load datasets (knowledge graphs).
* **Models**: knowledge graph embedding models. AmpliGraph offers **TransE**, **DistMult**, **ComplEx**, **HolE**, **RotatE** (More to come!)
* **Evaluation**: metrics and evaluation protocols to assess the predictive power of the models.
* **Discovery**: High-level convenience APIs for knowledge discovery (discover new facts, cluster entities, predict near duplicates).
* **Compat**: submodule that extends the compatibility of AmpliGraph APIs to those of AmpliGraph 1.x for the user already familiar with them.
