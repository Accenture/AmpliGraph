# Installation

## Prerequisites

* Linux Box
* Python ≥ 3.6

#### Provision a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment (conda)

conda create --name ampligraph python=3.6
source activate ampligraph
```

#### Install TensorFlow

AmpliGraph is built on TensorFlow 1.x.
Install from pip or conda:

**CPU-only**

```
pip install "tensorflow>=1.13.1,<2.0"

or 

conda install tensorflow=1.13.1
```

**GPU support**

## Install AmpliGraph


Install the latest stable release from pip:

```
pip install ampligraph
```


If instead you want the most recent development version, you can clone the repository
and install from source as below (also see the [How to Contribute guide](dev.md) for details):

```
git clone https://github.com/Accenture/AmpliGraph.git
cd AmpliGraph
git checkout develop
pip install -e .
```

## Sanity Check

```python
>> import ampligraph
>> ampligraph.__version__
'1.2-dev'
```
