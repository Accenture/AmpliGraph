# Clustering and Classification using Knowledge Graph Embeddings
---

In this tutorial we will explore how to use the knowledge embeddings generated by a graph of international football matches (since the 19th century) in clustering and classification tasks. Knowledge graph embeddings are typically used for missing link prediction and knowledge discovery, but they can also be used for entity clustering, entity disambiguation, and other downstream tasks. The embeddings are a form of representation learning that allow linear algebra and machine learning to be applied to knowledge graphs, which otherwise would be difficult to do.


We will cover in this tutorial:

1. Creating the knowledge graph (i.e. triples) from a tabular dataset of football matches
2. Training the ComplEx embedding model on those triples
3. Evaluating the quality of the embeddings on a validation set
4. Clustering the embeddings, comparing to the natural clusters formed by the geographical continents
5. Applying the embeddings as features in classification task, to predict match results
6. Evaluating the predictive model on a out-of-time test set, comparing to a simple baseline

We will show that knowledge embedding clusters manage to capture implicit geographical information from the graph and that they can be a useful feature source for a downstream machine learning classification task, significantly increasing accuracy from the baseline.

## Requirements

A Python environment with the AmpliGraph library installed. Please follow the [install guide](http://docs.ampligraph.org/en/latest/install.html).

Some sanity check:


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import ampligraph

ampligraph.__version__
```




    '1.1-dev'



## Dataset

We will use the [International football results from 1872 to 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017) available on Kaggle (public domain). It contains over 40 thousand international football matches. Each row contains the following information:
1. Match date
2. Home team name
3. Away team name
4. Home score (goals including extra time)
5. Away score (goals including extra time)
6. Tournament (whether it was a friendly match or part of a tournament)
7. City where match took place
8. Country where match took place
9. Whether match was on neutral grounds

This dataset comes in a tabular format, therefore we will need to construct the knowledge graph ourselves.


```python
import requests
url = 'https://ampligraph.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/datasets/football_graph.csv'
open('football_results.csv', 'wb').write(requests.get(url).content)
```




    3033782




```python
df = pd.read_csv("football_results.csv").sort_values("date")
```


```python
df.isna().sum()
```




    date          0
    home_team     0
    away_team     0
    home_score    2
    away_score    2
    tournament    0
    city          0
    country       0
    neutral       0
    dtype: int64



Dropping matches with unknown score:


```python
df = df.dropna()
```

The training set will be from 1872 to 2014, while the test set will be from 2014 to present date. Note that a temporal test set makes any machine learning task harder compared to a random shuffle.


```python
df["train"] = df.date < "2014-01-01"
```


```python
df.train.value_counts()
```




    True     35714
    False     5057
    Name: train, dtype: int64



## Knowledge graph creation
We are going to create a knowledge graph from scratch based on the match information. The idea is that each match is an entity that will be connected to its participating teams, geography, characteristics, and results. 

The objective is to generate a new representation of the dataset where each data point is an triple in the form:

    <subject, predicate, object>
    
First we need to create the entities (subjects and objects) that will form the graph. We make sure teams and geographical information result in different entities (e.g. the Brazilian team and the corresponding country will be different).


```python
# Entities naming
df["match_id"] = df.index.values.astype(str)
df["match_id"] =  "Match" + df.match_id
df["city_id"] = "City" + df.city.str.title().str.replace(" ", "")
df["country_id"] = "Country" + df.country.str.title().str.replace(" ", "")
df["home_team_id"] = "Team" + df.home_team.str.title().str.replace(" ", "")
df["away_team_id"] = "Team" + df.away_team.str.title().str.replace(" ", "")
df["tournament_id"] = "Tournament" + df.tournament.str.title().str.replace(" ", "")
df["neutral"] = df.neutral.astype(str)
```

Then, we create the actual triples based on the relationship between the entities. We do it only for the triples in the training set (before 2014).


```python
triples = []
for _, row in df[df["train"]].iterrows():
    # Home and away information
    home_team = (row["home_team_id"], "isHomeTeamIn", row["match_id"])
    away_team = (row["away_team_id"], "isAwayTeamIn", row["match_id"])
    
    # Match results
    if row["home_score"] > row["away_score"]:
        score_home = (row["home_team_id"], "winnerOf", row["match_id"])
        score_away = (row["away_team_id"], "loserOf", row["match_id"])
    elif row["home_score"] < row["away_score"]:
        score_away = (row["away_team_id"], "winnerOf", row["match_id"])
        score_home = (row["home_team_id"], "loserOf", row["match_id"])
    else:
        score_home = (row["home_team_id"], "draws", row["match_id"])
        score_away = (row["away_team_id"], "draws", row["match_id"])
    home_score = (row["match_id"], "homeScores", np.clip(int(row["home_score"]), 0, 5))
    away_score = (row["match_id"], "awayScores", np.clip(int(row["away_score"]), 0, 5))
    
    # Match characteristics
    tournament = (row["match_id"], "inTournament", row["tournament_id"])
    city = (row["match_id"], "inCity", row["city_id"])
    country = (row["match_id"], "inCountry", row["country_id"])
    neutral = (row["match_id"], "isNeutral", row["neutral"])
    year = (row["match_id"], "atYear", row["date"][:4])
    
    triples.extend((home_team, away_team, score_home, score_away, 
                    tournament, city, country, neutral, year, home_score, away_score))
```

Note that we treat some literals (year, neutral match, home score, away score) as discrete entities and they will be part of the final knowledge graph used to generate the embeddings. We limit the number of score entities by clipping the score to be at most 5.

Below we can see visualise a subset of the graph related to the infamous [Maracanazo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_v_Brazil_(1950_FIFA_World_Cup)):

![](img/FootballGraph.png)

The whole graph related to this match can be summarised by the triples below:


```python
triples_df = pd.DataFrame(triples, columns=["subject", "predicate", "object"])
triples_df[(triples_df.subject=="Match3129") | (triples_df.object=="Match3129")]
```

## Training knowledge graph embeddings

We split our training dataset further into training and validation, where the new training set will be used to the knowledge embedding training and the validation set will be used in its evaluation. The test set will be used to evaluate the performance of the classification algorithm built on top of the embeddings.

What differs from the standard method of randomly sampling N points to make up our validation set is that our data points are two entities linked by some relationship, and we need to take care to ensure that all entities are represented in train and validation sets by at least one triple.

To accomplish this, AmpliGraph provides the [`train_test_split_no_unseen`](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/latest/generated/ampligraph.evaluation.train_test_split_no_unseen.html#train-test-split-no-unseen) function.


```python
from ampligraph.evaluation import train_test_split_no_unseen 

X_train, X_valid = train_test_split_no_unseen(np.array(triples), test_size=10000)
```


```python
print('Train set size: ', X_train.shape)
print('Test set size: ', X_valid.shape)
```

    Train set size:  (382854, 3)
    Test set size:  (10000, 3)


AmpliGraph has implemented [several Knowledge Graph Embedding models](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/latest/ampligraph.latent_features.html#knowledge-graph-embedding-models) (TransE, ComplEx, DistMult, HolE), but to begin with we're just going to use the [ComplEx](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/latest/generated/ampligraph.latent_features.ComplEx.html#ampligraph.latent_features.ComplEx) model, which is known to bring state-of-the-art predictive power.

The hyper-parameter choice was based on the [best results](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/latest/experiments.html) we have found so far for the ComplEx model applied to some benchmark datasets used in the knowledge graph embeddings community. This tutorial does not cover [hyper-parameter tuning](https://docs.ampligraph.org/en/latest/examples.html#model-selection).



```python
from ampligraph.latent_features import ComplEx

model = ComplEx(batches_count=50,
                epochs=300,
                k=100,
                eta=20,
                optimizer='adam', 
                optimizer_params={'lr':1e-4},
                loss='multiclass_nll',
                regularizer='LP', 
                regularizer_params={'p':3, 'lambda':1e-5}, 
                seed=0, 
                verbose=True)
```

Lets go through the parameters to understand what's going on:

- **`batches_count`** : the number of batches in which the training set is split during the training loop. If you are having into low memory issues than settings this to a higher number may help.
- **`epochs`** : the number of epochs to train the model for.
- **`k`**: the dimensionality of the embedding space.
- **`eta`** ($\\eta$) : the number of negative, or false triples that must be generated at training runtime for each positive, or true triple.
- **`optimizer`** : the Adam optimizer, with a learning rate of 1e-4 set via the *optimizer_params* kwarg.
- **`loss`** : pairwise loss, with a margin of 0.5 set via the *loss_params* kwarg.
- **`regularizer`** : $L_p$ regularization with $p=3$, i.e. l3 regularization. $\\lambda$ = 1e-5, set via the *regularizer_params* kwarg.
- **`seed`** : random seed, used for reproducibility.
- **`verbose`** - displays a progress bar.

Training should take around 10 minutes on a modern GPU:


```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.ERROR)

model.fit(X_train)
```

    Average Loss:   0.400814: 100%|██████████| 300/300 [09:58<00:00,  2.01s/epoch]


## Evaluating knowledge embeddings

AmpliGraph aims to follow scikit-learn's ease-of-use design philosophy and simplify everything down to **`fit`**, **`evaluate`**, and **`predict`** functions.

However, there are some knowledge graph specific steps we must take to ensure our model can be trained and evaluated correctly. The first of these is defining the filter that will be used to ensure that no negative statements generated by the corruption procedure are actually positives. This is simply done by concatenating our train and test sets. Now when negative triples are generated by the corruption strategy, we can check that they aren't actually true statements.


```python
filter_triples = np.concatenate((X_train, X_valid))
```

For this we'll use the `evaluate_performance` function:

- **`X`** - the data to evaluate on. We're going to use our test set to evaluate.
- **`model`** - the model we previously trained.
- **`filter_triples`** - will filter out the false negatives generated by the corruption strategy.
- **`use_default_protocol`** - specifies whether to use the default corruption protocol. If True, then subj and obj are corrupted separately during evaluation.
- **`verbose`** - displays a progress bar.


```python
from ampligraph.evaluation import evaluate_performance

ranks = evaluate_performance(X_valid,
                             model=model, 
                             filter_triples=filter_triples,
                             use_default_protocol=True,
                             verbose=True)
```

    100%|██████████| 10000/10000 [02:09<00:00, 77.33it/s]


We're going to use the mrr_score (mean reciprocal rank) and hits_at_n_score functions.

- **mrr_score**: The function computes the mean of the reciprocal of elements of a vector of rankings ranks.
- **hits_at_n_score**: The function computes how many elements of a vector of rankings ranks make it to the top n positions.


```python
from ampligraph.evaluation import mr_score, mrr_score, hits_at_n_score

mr = mr_score(ranks)
mrr = mrr_score(ranks)

print("MRR: %.2f" % (mrr))
print("MR: %.2f" % (mr))

hits_10 = hits_at_n_score(ranks, n=10)
print("Hits@10: %.2f" % (hits_10))
hits_3 = hits_at_n_score(ranks, n=3)
print("Hits@3: %.2f" % (hits_3))
hits_1 = hits_at_n_score(ranks, n=1)
print("Hits@1: %.2f" % (hits_1))
```

    MRR: 0.26
    MR: 4365.06
    Hits@10: 0.36
    Hits@3: 0.29
    Hits@1: 0.19


We can interpret these results by stating that the model will rank the correct entity within the top-3 possibilities 29% of the time. 

By themselves, these metrics are not enough to conclude the usefulness of the embeddings in a downstream task, but they suggest that the embeddings have learned a reasonable representation enough to consider using them in more tasks.

## Clustering and embedding visualization

To evaluate the subjective quality of the embeddings, we can visualise the embeddings on 2D space and also cluster them on the original space. We can compare the clustered embeddings with natural clusters, in this case the continent where the team is from, so that we have a ground truth to evaluate the clustering quality both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Requirements:

* seaborn
* adjustText
* incf.countryutils

For seaborn and adjustText, simply install them with `pip install seaborn adjustText`.

For incf.countryutils, do the following steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wyldebeast-wunderliebe/incf.countryutils.git
cd incf.countryutils
pip install .```


```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from adjustText import adjust_text
from incf.countryutils import transformations
%matplotlib inline
```

We create a map from the team ID (e.g. "TeamBrazil") to the team name (e.g. "Brazil") for visualization purposes.


```python
id_to_name_map = {**dict(zip(df.home_team_id, df.home_team)), **dict(zip(df.away_team_id, df.away_team))}
```

We now create a dictionary with the embeddings of all teams:


```python
teams = pd.concat((df.home_team_id[df["train"]], df.away_team_id[df["train"]])).unique()
team_embeddings = dict(zip(teams, model.get_embeddings(teams)))
```

We use PCA to project the embeddings from the 200 space into 2D space:


```python
embeddings_2d = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(np.array([i for i in team_embeddings.values()]))
```

We will cluster the teams embeddings on its original 200-dimensional space using the `find_clusters` in our discovery API:


```python
from ampligraph.discovery import find_clusters
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

clustering_algorithm = KMeans(n_clusters=6, n_init=50, max_iter=500, random_state=0)
clusters = find_clusters(teams, model, clustering_algorithm, mode='entity')
```

This helper function uses the `incf.countryutils` library to translate country names to their corresponding continents.


```python
def cn_to_ctn(country):
    try:
        return transformations.cn_to_ctn(id_to_name_map[country])
    except KeyError:
        return "unk"
```

This dataframe contains for each team their projected embeddings to 2D space via PCA, their continent and the KMeans cluster. This will be used alongisde Seaborn to make the visualizations. 


```python
plot_df = pd.DataFrame({"teams": teams, 
                        "embedding1": embeddings_2d[:, 0], 
                        "embedding2": embeddings_2d[:, 1],
                        "continent": pd.Series(teams).apply(cn_to_ctn),
                        "cluster": "cluster" + pd.Series(clusters).astype(str)})
```

We plot the results on a 2D scatter plot, coloring the teams by the continent or cluster and also displaying some individual team names. 

We always display the names of the top 20 teams (according to [FIFA rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Rankings)) and a random subset of the rest.


```python
top20teams = ["TeamBelgium", "TeamFrance", "TeamBrazil", "TeamEngland", "TeamPortugal", "TeamCroatia", "TeamSpain", 
              "TeamUruguay", "TeamSwitzerland", "TeamDenmark", "TeamArgentina", "TeamGermany", "TeamColombia",
              "TeamItaly", "TeamNetherlands", "TeamChile", "TeamSweden", "TeamMexico", "TeamPoland", "TeamIran"]

def plot_clusters(hue):
    np.random.seed(0)
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12))
    plt.title("{} embeddings".format(hue).capitalize())
    ax = sns.scatterplot(data=plot_df[plot_df.continent!="unk"], x="embedding1", y="embedding2", hue=hue)
    texts = []
    for i, point in plot_df.iterrows():
        if point["teams"] in top20teams or np.random.random() < 0.1:
            texts.append(plt.text(point['embedding1']+0.02, point['embedding2']+0.01, str(point["teams"])))
    adjust_text(texts)
```

The first visualisation of the 2D embeddings shows the natural geographical clusters (continents), which can be seen as a form of the ground truth:


```python
plot_clusters("continent")
```


![](img/output_53_0.png)


We can see above that the embeddings learned geographical similarities even though this information was not explicit on the original dataset.

Now we plot the same 2D embeddings but with the clusters found by K-Means:


```python
plot_clusters("cluster")
```


![](img/output_55_0.png)


We can see that K-Means found very similar cluster to the natural geographical clusters by the continents. This shows that on the 200-dimensional embedding space, similar teams appear close together, which can be captured by a clustering algorithm.

Our evaluation of the clusters can be more objective by using a metric such as the [adjusted Rand score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score.html), which varies from -1 to 1, where 0 is random labelling and 1 is a perfect match:


```python
from sklearn import metrics
metrics.adjusted_rand_score(plot_df.continent, plot_df.cluster)
```




    0.39274828260196304



## Classification

We will use the knowledge embeddings to predict future matches as a classification problem.

We can model it as a multiclass problem with three classes: home team wins, home team loses, draw.

The embeddings are used directly as features to a XGBoost classifier.

First we need to determine the target:


```python
df["results"] = (df.home_score > df.away_score).astype(int) + \
                (df.home_score == df.away_score).astype(int)*2 + \
                (df.home_score < df.away_score).astype(int)*3 - 1
```


```python
df.results.value_counts(normalize=True)
```




    0    0.486473
    2    0.282456
    1    0.231071
    Name: results, dtype: float64



Now we create a function that extracts the features (knowledge embeddings for home and away teams) and the target for a particular subset of the dataset:


```python
def get_features_target(mask):
    
    def get_embeddings(team):
        return team_embeddings.get(team, np.full(200, np.nan))
    
    X = np.hstack((np.vstack(df[mask].home_team_id.apply(get_embeddings).values),
                   np.vstack(df[mask].away_team_id.apply(get_embeddings).values)))
    y = df[mask].results.values
    return X, y
```


```python
clf_X_train, y_train = get_features_target((df["train"]))
clf_X_test, y_test = get_features_target((~df["train"]))
```


```python
clf_X_train.shape, clf_X_test.shape
```




    ((35714, 400), (5057, 400))



Note that we have 200 features by team because the ComplEx model uses imaginary and real number for its embeddings, so we have twice as many parameters as defined by `k=100` in its model definition.

We also have some missing information from the embeddings of the entities (i.e. teams) that only appear in the test set, which are unlikely to be correctly classified:


```python
np.isnan(clf_X_test).sum()/clf_X_test.shape[1]
```




    105.0



First install xgboost with `pip install xboost`.


```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
```

Create a multiclass model with 500 estimators:


```python
clf_model = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_depth=5, objective="multi:softmax")
```

Fit the model using all of the training samples:


```python
clf_model.fit(clf_X_train, y_train)
```




    XGBClassifier(base_score=0.5, booster='gbtree', colsample_bylevel=1,
                  colsample_bytree=1, gamma=0, learning_rate=0.1, max_delta_step=0,
                  max_depth=5, min_child_weight=1, missing=None, n_estimators=500,
                  n_jobs=1, nthread=None, objective='multi:softprob',
                  random_state=0, reg_alpha=0, reg_lambda=1, scale_pos_weight=1,
                  seed=None, silent=True, subsample=1)



The baseline accuracy for this problem is 47%, as that is the frequency of the most frequent class (home team wins):


```python
df[~df["train"]].results.value_counts(normalize=True)
```




    0    0.471030
    2    0.287325
    1    0.241645
    Name: results, dtype: float64




```python
metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, clf_model.predict(clf_X_test))
```




    0.5378683013644453



In conclusion, while the baseline for this classification problem was 47%, with just the knowledge embeddings alone we were able to build a classifier that achieves **54%** accuracy.

As future work, we could add more features to the model (not embeddings related) and tune the model hyper-parameters.
