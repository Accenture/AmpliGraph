Datasets
========
.. currentmodule:: ampligraph.datasets

.. automodule:: ampligraph.datasets


.. note::
    It is recommended to set the ``AMPLIGRAPH_DATA_HOME`` environment variable::

        export AMPLIGRAPH_DATA_HOME=/YOUR/PATH/TO/datasets

    When attempting to load a dataset, the module will first check if ``AMPLIGRAPH_DATA_HOME`` is set.
    If it is, it will search this location for the required dataset.
    If the dataset is not found it will be downloaded and placed in this directory.

    If ``AMPLIGRAPH_DATA_HOME`` has not been set the databases will be saved in the following directory::

        ~/ampligraph_datasets

Benchmark Datasets Loaders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use these helpers functions to load datasets used in graph representation learning literature.
The functions will **automatically download** the datasets if they are not present in ``~/ampligraph_datasets`` or
at the location set in ``AMPLIGRAPH_DATA_HOME``.

.. warning::
    WN18 and FB15k include a large number of inverse relations, and its use in experiments has been deprecated.
    **Use WN18RR and FB15K-237 instead**.


.. warning:: FB15K-237's validation set contains 8 unseen entities over 9 triples. The test set has 29 unseen entities,
        distributed over 28 triples. WN18RR's validation set contains 198 unseen entities over 210 triples. The test set
        has 209 unseen entities, distributed over 210 triples.

Loaders for Custom Knowledge Graphs

.. hint::
    AmpliGraph includes a helper function to split a generic knowledge graphs into **training**,
    **validation**, and **test** sets. See :meth:`ampligraph.evaluation.train_test_split_no_unseen`.
