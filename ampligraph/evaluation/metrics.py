def hits_at_n_score(ranks, n):
    r"""Hits@N

    The function computes how many elements of a vector of rankings ``ranks`` make it to the top ``n`` positions.

    It can be used in conjunction with the learning to rank evaluation protocol of
    :meth:`ampligraph.evaluation.evaluate_performance`.

    It is formally defined as follows:

    .. math::

        Hits@N = \sum_{i = 1}^{|Q|} 1 \, \text{if } rank_{(s, p, o)_i} \leq N

    where :math:`Q` is a set of triples and :math:`(s, p, o)` is a triple :math:`\in Q`.


    Consider the following example. Each of the two positive triples identified by ``*`` are ranked
    against four corruptions each. When scored by an embedding model, the first triple ranks 2nd, and the other triple
    ranks first. Hits@1 and Hits@3 are: ::

        s	 p	   o		score	rank
        Jack   born_in   Ireland	0.789	   1
        Jack   born_in   Italy		0.753	   2  *
        Jack   born_in   Germany	0.695	   3
        Jack   born_in   China		0.456	   4
        Jack   born_in   Thomas		0.234	   5

        Jack   friend_with   Thomas	0.901	   1  *
        Jack   friend_with   China      0.345	   2
        Jack   friend_with   Italy      0.293	   3
        Jack   friend_with   Ireland	0.201	   4

        Hits@1=0.5


    Parameters
    ----------
    ranks: ndarray or list, shape [n] or [n,2]
        Input ranks of n test statements.
    n: int
        The maximum rank considered to accept a positive.

    Returns
    -------
    hits_n_score: float
        The Hits@n score

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from ampligraph.evaluation.metrics import hits_at_n_score
    >>> rankings = np.array([1, 12, 6, 2])

def mrr_score(ranks):
    r"""Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

    The function computes the mean of the reciprocal of elements of a vector of rankings ``ranks``.

    It is used in conjunction with the learning to rank evaluation protocol of
    :meth:`ampligraph.evaluation.evaluate_performance`.

    It is formally defined as follows:

    .. math::

        MRR = \frac{1}{|Q|}\sum_{i = 1}^{|Q|}\frac{1}{rank_{(s, p, o)_i}}

    where :math:`Q` is a set of triples and :math:`(s, p, o)` is a triple :math:`\in Q`.

    .. note::
        This metric is similar to mean rank (MR) :meth:`ampligraph.evaluation.mr_score`. Instead of averaging ranks,
        it averages their reciprocals. This is done to obtain a metric which is more robust to outliers.


    Consider the following example. Each of the two positive triples identified by ``*`` are ranked
    against four corruptions each. When scored by an embedding model, the first triple ranks 2nd, and the other triple
    ranks first. The resulting MRR is: ::

        s	 p	   o		score	rank
        Jack   born_in   Ireland	0.789	   1
